            The concept of the magazine “World of Dance” shown in this project
            is to introduce the audience to original dances from different
            countries. The issue presented is dedicated to showing original
            dances from Argentina. This project became very personal to me
            because Argentinian dances have played a major role in my life as my
            main hobby. I have been dancing Argentinian folklore dances and
            tango for about 10 years now. All the photos used in this artwork
            are part of a collection of photos from my past performances.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            I used the following software for this project: Photoshop, InDesign,
            and Illustrator. My goal for this project was to create a design
            that portrays the spirit of Argentinian dances. That’s why I choose
            different color variations on different pages. The first page of
            this project is about folklore dances; Chacarera, Malambo,
            Escondido, and Gato. They originate from rural areas of Argentina.
            Because of this, I chose to use a photo of my cousin and I dancing
            in front of my grandparents’ wooden house in the countryside.

            All the types of dances I describe on the first page have a similar
            vibe, they all have fast, energetic, joyful, and allegro music
            tempo. The color palette of the first page corresponds to that vibe.
            I used burgundy and scarlet shades of red in combination with a
            complimentary grass green color. The second and third pages are
            paired together and have the same color scheme. Blue is the color of
            the official flag of Argentina.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The dance theme for these pages is Tango, which is the most popular
            dance originating from Argentina. Tango in its very nature is more
            sophisticated and comes from the urban area of Buenos Aires which
            corresponds to a more minimalistic and elegant in design. The color
            scheme of the 1st and 4th pages is different from the 2nd and 3rd
            pages, although the Scarlet red color of the tango dancer dress
            makes a pleasing transition between them and links them all
            together.

            The target audience of this newsletter could be travelers but also
            people who like to learn more about different countries and their
            original and folkloric dances. Referencing traveling elements of
            design is presented through icons showing airplanes, world maps, and
            the earth’s globe.
