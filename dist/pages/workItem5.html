          <br />
          <p>
            The concept of the magazine “World of Dance” shown in this project
            is to introduce the audience with original dances from different
            countries. The issue that I’m presenting here is dedicated to
            showing original dances from Argentina. This project became very
            personal to me because Argentinian dances have played a major role
            in my life as my main hobby. I have been dancing Argentinian
            folklore dances and tango for about 10 years now. All the photos
            used in this artwork are part of a collection of photos from my past
            performances.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            The software I used for this project is Photoshop, InDesign, and
            Illustrator. My goal in this project was to create a design that
            portraits the spirit of Argentinian dances. That’s why I choose
            different color solutions in different pages. The first page of this
            project is about folklore dances Chacarera, Malambo, Escondido, and
            Gato. They are original from rural areas of Argentina. Because of
            this reason I’ve chosen a photo of the countryside where my cousin
            and I are dancing in front of the wooden house of my grandparents.

            All the types of dances I describe on a first page have a similar
            vibe because they all have fast, energetic, joyful, and allegro
            music tempo. The color palette of the first page corresponds to
            that. I used a combination of Burgundy and Scarlet shades of Red
            color altogether with Grass green color. The second and third pages
            are paired pages and have the same color scheme. Blue is the color
            of the official flag of Argentina. The dance theme for these pages
            is Tango, which is the most popular dance coming from Argentina.
            Tango in its very nature is more sophisticated and comes from the
            urban area of Buenos Aires which corresponds to a more minimalistic
            and elegant design. The color scheme of the 1st and 4th pages is
            different from the 2nd and 3rd pages although the Scarlet red color
            of the tango dancer dress makes a peaceful transition between them
            and links them all together.

            people who like to learn more about different countries and their
            original and folkloric dances. Reference to traveling elements of
