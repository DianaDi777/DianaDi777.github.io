              The main goal was to do a significant improvement in user
              experience. In order to reach that goal following stages of
              designing proses were performed: <br />
              - Needs Analysis and Content Audit<br />
              - Creating user personas profile<br />
              - Competitive analysis of the three competitors on a market<br />
              - Developing a site map<br />
              - Performing cart sort and reverse cart sort<br />
              - Evolving results of cart sorting into Standardization Grid
              <br />
              - Defining user flow <br />
              - Prototyping (low, middle and high-fidelity prototypes of
              webpages)
              <br />
              The project was performed as a group class assignment of the Front
              End Web Development Certificate Program.

              Current Site is dated, poorly designed, and not user-friendly.

              A user persona is a fictional character created to represent a
              user type that might use a website. During the design process,
              it's important to refer to the user persona with an idea to
              satisfy customer needs. <br /><br />
              Because frozen yogurt as a product has a wide audience, we created
              4 potential persona profiles. Some UX specialists recommend having
              1 or 2 personas only to focus on your specific target audience. As
              a result, it eases the designers' decision making. That's why we
              also focused on one user profile only.

              Example of features that influenced our website design by one of

              - Very bright colors, lots of images of the frozen yogurt, most of
              the images have a combination of yogurt and people on it. Digital
              marketing studies show that images with people on it receive more
              engagement on social media and the web in general. <br />
              - Probably this website got most of the view on a mobile screen.
              That's why it's very mobile-friendly. Also promotional material

              content was unnecessary and needed to be removed. <br />
