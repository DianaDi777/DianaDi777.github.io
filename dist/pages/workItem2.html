              The main goal was to significantly improve the user experience. To
              reach our goal we implemented the following stages of the design
              process:
              <br />
              - Needs Analysis and Content Audit
              <br />
              - Created user persona profiles<br />
              - Competitive analysis of three market competitors<br />
              - Developed a site map<br />
              - Performed card sorts and reverse card sorts
              <br />
              - Analyzed card sort results by creating a Standardization Grid
              <br />
              - Defined user flow <br />
              - Created low, middle and high-fidelity prototypes of webpages
              <br />
              This project was completed as a group class assignment of the
              Front End Web Development Certificate Program.

              The current site is dated, poorly designed, and not user-friendly.

              Desired Outcome: An aesthetically pleasing website that is easy to

              tropical-themed “dessert” oasis.
              <br /><br />
              Voice and Tone: Fun and cheerful yet direct and informative.

              A user persona is a fictional character created to represent a
              user type that might use the website. During the design process,
              it's important to refer to the user persona with the purpose of
              satisfying that customer’s needs. <br /><br />
              Frozen yogurt has a broad consumer base, therefore we created four
              potential persona profiles. Some UX specialists recommend only
              having one or two personas to focus on the specific target
              audience. This eases the designers' decision-making process. After
              creating various personas we narrowed our focus to one user
              profile.

              PINKBERRY:

              - Very bright colors, lots of images of the frozen yogurt. Most
              images have a combination of yogurt and people. Digital marketing
              studies show that images of people receive more engagement on
              social media and the web. <br />
              - This website anticipates that most of its audience will be on
              viewing it on a mobile device and is designed to be
              mobile-friendly. Promotional material contains a lot of images of
              the mobile screen with a pinkberry.com website on it.

              <strong>- "Where do you find hours of operation?"</strong><br />

              - The reverse card sort helped flesh out what we already knew,

              content was unnecessary and needed to be removed.
              <br />
              - The reverse card sort prioritized content and determined where

              <br />
              After Cart Sort and Reverse Cart Sort had been performed, the
