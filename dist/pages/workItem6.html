            The name of this fictitious book is “1001 California sunset”. It is
            a reference to the famous ancient Arabic book – “The Book of One
            Thousand and One Nights”. In that book, Scheherazade, the wife of
            the king tells his husband a new story every night for 1001 nights
            as she is trying to save herself from execution. From this
            reference, the number 1001 is used as a generic term for a very
            large number. All the sunsets we are witnessing every night are
            completely different. Every sunset is like a profound story. Some of
            them are dramatic, some others are fun and playful. The sun goes
            away every night but the beauty of the sunset gives us hope that it
            will get backs tomorrow with a new tale… like Scheherazade comes up
            with a new story every night with the hope to postpone her
            execution…

            The whole artwork was created in Adobe Photoshop. All in all, I used
            seven photos in different arrangements. Five of them are photos of
            sunsets and two are photos of photographer’s figures. Even though
            the title of the book came as a reference of the ancient Arabic
            book, this is not a fictional book but a photography guide. This
            book is meant to be a guide for photographers with different
            techniques on how to make a perfect sunset photo and also how to
            edit it later with a program like Photoshop. That’s why on the book
            cover you would see two images of photographers trying to shoot the
            perfect sunset photo. The work is done in warm colors because the
            main goal was to present a cozy mood of the sunset.

            All the types of dances I describe on a first page have a similar
            vibe because they all have fast, energetic, joyful, and allegro
            music tempo. The color palette of the first page corresponds to
            that. I used a combination of Burgundy and Scarlet shades of Red
            color altogether with Grass green color. The second and third pages
            are paired pages and have the same color scheme. Blue is the color
            of the official flag of Argentina. The dance theme for these pages
            is Tango, which is the most popular dance coming from Argentina.
            Tango in its very nature is more sophisticated and comes from the
            urban area of Buenos Aires which corresponds to a more minimalistic
            and elegant design. The color scheme of the 1st and 4th pages is
            different from the 2nd and 3rd pages although the Scarlet red color
            of the tango dancer dress makes a peaceful transition between them
            and links them all together.
