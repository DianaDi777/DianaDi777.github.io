            The name of this fictitious book is “1001 California Sunsets”. It is
            a reference to the famous ancient Arabic book – “One Thousand and
            One Nights.” In that book, Scheherazade, the wife of the king, tells
            her husband a new story every night for 1,001 nights to save herself
            from execution. Using this book as a reference, the number of 1,001
            is used as a generic term for a very large number. All the sunsets
            we witness every evening are completely different. Every sunset is
            like a profound story. Some of them are dramatic, while others are
            fun and playful. The sun goes away every night but the beauty of the
            sunset gives us hope that it will come back tomorrow with a new
            tale, just like Scheherazade comes up with a new story every
            night...

            The artwork was created in Adobe Photoshop. All in all, I used seven
            photos in different arrangements. Five of them are photos of sunsets
            and two are figures of photographers. Even though the title of the
            book references the ancient Arabic book, this is not a fictional
            book but a photography guide. This book is meant to be a guide for
            photographers with different techniques on how to make a perfect
            sunset photo and also how to edit it later with a program like
            Photoshop. That’s why there are two images of photographers trying
            to shoot the perfect sunset photo on the cover. The artwork is done
            in warm colors because the main goal was to recreate the cozy mood
            of a sunset.
